# bikebenefits
'old school' static html page with bike benefits info and vanilla js. designed to be the fastest way to look up my local bike benefits deals on mobile.


bicycle benefits has a map that works poorly on mobile. generally i'm aware of the locations on the list, but i wanted a way to quickly reference what deals they offer.
